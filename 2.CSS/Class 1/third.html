            Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger that records transactions across a peer-to-peer network. It's like a shared, transparent, and secure database that eliminates the need for a central authority to verify transactions. This technology has applications beyond cryptocurrency, including supply chain management, healthcare, and finance.
